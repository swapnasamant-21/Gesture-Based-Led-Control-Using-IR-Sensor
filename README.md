# Gesture-Based-Led-Control-Using-IR-Sensor

Project Overview :

This project demonstrates a hand gesture-controlled LED system using two IR sensors.

Swipe your hand left to right: Turns RED LED ON, and OFF on the next swipe.

Swipe your hand right to left: Turns GREEN LED ON, and OFF on the next swipe.


This is a simple yet interactive system for demonstrating gesture-based control using IR sensors and a microcontroller (like LPC2148).

Components Required :

2 × IR Sensors

1 × Microcontroller (esp32)

1 × Red LED

1 × Green LED
